  abstract = {Background: Rapid point-of-care polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic tests generally provide a qualitative result of positive or negative only. Additional information about the relative viral load could be calculated. Such quantitative information might be useful for making treatment decisions. Methods: We enrolled students at a university health center who presented with cough and 1 additional flu-like symptom from December 2016 to February 2017. Data were collected before, during, and 5 days after the clinic visit. All those enrolled in the study received a point-of-care PCR test (cobas Liat). For those patients that tested positive for influenza A, we investigated correlations between the relative viral load and measures of disease severity and recovery. Results: One hundred thirty-five students tested positive for influenza A. We found a positive correlation between viral load and body temperature. Time since symptom onset seemed to have a negative correlation but was not statistically significant. We did not find any correlations between viral load and overall symptom severity or outcomes related to recovery. Conclusions: Although we found a correlation between relative viral load and body temperature, for our study population of young, overall healthy adults, we did not find that relative viral load provided additional information that could help in determining treatment and disease outcomes. It could be that viral load does provide useful additional information for other groups of patients, such as young children or older adults. Further studies on those populations are warranted.},

  abstract = {Communicable diseases are often virulent, i.e. they cause morbidity symptoms in those infected. While some symptoms may be transmission- enhancing, other symptoms are likely to reduce transmission potential. For human diseases, the reduction in transmission opportunities is commonly caused by reduced activity. There is limited data regarding the potential impact of virulence on transmission potential. We performed an exploratory data analysis of 324 influenza patients at a university health centre during the 2016/2017 influenza season. We classified symptoms as infectiousness-related or morbidity-related and calculated two scores. The scores were used to explore the relationship between infectiousness, morbidity (virulence), and activity level. We found a decrease in the activity level with increasing morbidity scores. There was no consistent pattern between an activity level and an infectiousness score. We also found a positive correlation between morbidity and infectiousness scores. Overall, we find that increasing virulence leads to increased infectiousness and reduced activity, suggesting a trade-off that can impact overall transmission potential. Our findings indicate that a reduction of systemic symptoms may increase host activity without reducing infectiousness. Therefore, interventions should target both systemic- and infectiousness-related symptoms to reduce overall transmission potential. Our findings can also inform simulation models that investigate the impact of different interventions on transmission.},

  abstract = {Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease that, in humans, is caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses. Typically characterized by annual seasonal epidemics, sporadic pandemic outbreaks involve influenza A virus strains of zoonotic origin. The WHO estimates that annual epidemics of influenza result in ~1 billion infections, 3-5 million cases of severe illness and 300,000-500,000 deaths. The severity of pandemic influenza depends on multiple factors, including the virulence of the pandemic virus strain and the level of pre-existing immunity. The most severe influenza pandemic, in 1918, resulted in >40 million deaths worldwide. Influenza vaccines are formulated every year to match the circulating strains, as they evolve antigenically owing to antigenic drift. Nevertheless, vaccine efficacy is not optimal and is dramatically low in the case of an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating virus strain. Antiviral agents that target the influenza virus enzyme neuraminidase have been developed for prophylaxis and therapy. However, the use of these antivirals is still limited. Emerging approaches to combat influenza include the development of universal influenza virus vaccines that provide protection against antigenically distant influenza viruses, but these vaccines need to be tested in clinical trials to ascertain their effectiveness.
Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease that, in humans, is caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses. This Primer discusses the biological features of influenza viruses, their effects on human and animal health and the mitigation strategies to reduce the burden of this disease.

  abstract = {Influenza is an acute respiratory disease caused by the influenza A or B virus. 
      It often occurs in outbreaks and epidemics worldwide, mainly during the winter 
      season. Significant numbers of influenza virus particles are present in the 
      respiratory secretions of infected persons, so infection can be transmitted by 
      sneezing and coughing via large particle droplets. The mean duration of influenza 
      virus shedding in immunocompetent adult patients is around 5 days but may 
      continue for up to 10 days or more-particularly in children, elderly adults, 
      patients with chronic illnesses, and immunocompromised hosts. Influenza typically 
      begins with the abrupt onset of high-grade fever, myalgia, headache, and malaise. 
      These manifestations are accompanied by symptoms of respiratory tract illnesses 
      such as nonproductive cough, sore throat, and nasal discharge. After a typical 
      course, influenza can affect other organs such as the lungs, brain, and heart 
      more than it can affect the respiratory tract and cause hospitalization. The best 
      way to prevent influenza is to administer annual vaccinations. Among severely ill 
      patients, an early commencement of antiviral treatment (<2 d from illness onset) 
      is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality, with greater benefits allied 
      to an earlier initiation of treatment. Given the significance of the disease 
      burden, we reviewed the latest findings in the diagnosis and management of 
      influenza.},

Mechanisms by which viruses evolve in one host, cause zoonotic infection, and adapt to a new host species remain unelucidated.

Viruses use all known mechanisms of variation; mutation, several forms of recombination, and segment reassortment in the case of viruses with a segmented genome. These processes are intimately connected with the replicative machineries of viruses, as well as with fundamental physical-chemical properties of nucleotides when acting as template or substrate residues. Recombination has been viewed as a means to rescue viable genomes from unfit parents or to produce large modifications for the exploration of phenotypic novelty. All types of genetic variation can act conjointly as blind processes to provide the raw materials for adaptation to the changing environments in which viruses must replicate. A distinction is made between mechanistically unavoidable and evolutionarily relevant mutation and recombination.},
